This is a set of scripts and files to build an OpenBSD machine into a firewall

You run it by running setup.sh

setup.sh will download the rest of the files that it needs to complete the install


The main features it configures for you are:
- PF firewall
- NAT
- External PPPoE connection
- Internal DHCP server for local devices
- DNS resolver hosted locally with unbound
- A bunch of local devices defined with static IPs using DHCP and unbound 
- NTP server that uses a USB attached GPS dongle to get precise time and server it locally and externally 


Outline for further developments:
- Convert the whole thing into a single file with here scripts, so you can paste it into a terminal (that might be easier)
- Make the script interactive, so it asks you what interfaces that you want to use...
