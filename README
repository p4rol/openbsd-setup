This is a set of scripts and files to build an OpenBSD machine into a firewall

You run it by running setup.sh

setup.sh will download the rest of the files that it needs to complete the install

I'm tempted to turn it all into a single file with here scripts. Let's see if there is time for that. 

The main features it configures for you are:
- PF firewall
- NAT
- External PPPoE connection
- Internal DHCP server for local devices
- DNS resolver hosted locally with unbound
- A bunch of local devices defined with static IPs using DHCP and unbound 
- NTP server that uses a USB attached GPS dongle to get precise time and server it locally and externally
